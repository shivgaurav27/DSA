.text-container {
  width: 400px;  /* Adjust width according to requirement */
  word-wrap: break-word; /* Advise long words to break */
  overflow-wrap: break-word;
}


While CSS handles text overflow effectively in many cases, 
using JavaScript allows you to dynamically adjust text 
properties based on external data inputs or events.
